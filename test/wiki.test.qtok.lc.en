the social science of law , jurisprudence , in common parlance , means a rule that ( unlike a rule of ethics ) is capable of enforcement through institutions . however , many laws are based on norms accepted by a community and thus have an ethical foundation . the study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities , depending on one 's view of research into its objectives and effects . law is not always enforceable , especially in the international relations context . it has been defined as a " system of rules " , as an " interpretive concept " to achieve justice , as an " authority " to mediate people 's interests , and even as " the command of a sovereign , backed by the threat of a sanction " . however one likes to think of law , it is a completely central social institution . legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every social science and the humanities . laws are politics , because politicians create them . law is philosophy , because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas . law tells many of history 's stories , because statutes , case law and codifications build up over time . and law is economics , because any rule about contract , tort , property law , labour law , company law and many more can have long-lasting effects on the distribution of wealth . the noun " law " derives from the late old english " lagu " , meaning something laid down or fixed and the adjective " legal " comes from the latin word " lex " .

shafts are quantified in a number of different ways . the most common is the shaft flex . simply , the shaft flex is the amount that the shaft will bend when placed under a load . a stiffer shaft will not flex as much , which requires more power to bend and " whip " through the ball properly ( which results in higher club speed at impact for more distance ) , while a more flexible shaft will whip with less power required for better distance on slower swings , but may torque and over-flex if swung with too much power causing the head not to be square , resulting in lower accuracy . most shaft makers offer a variety of flexes . the most common are : l ( lady ) , a ( soft regular , intermediate or senior ) , r ( regular ) , s ( stiff ) , and x ( tour stiff , extra stiff or strong ) . a regular flex shaft is generally appropriate for those with an average head speed ( 80-94 mph ) , while an a-flex ( or senior shaft ) is for players with a slower swing speed ( 70-79 mph ) , and the stiffer shafts , such as s-flex and x-flex ( stiff and extra-stiff shafts ) are reserved only for those players with an above average swinging speed , usually above . some companies also offer a " stiff-regular " or " firm " flex for players whose club speed falls in the upper range of a regular shaft ( 90-100 mph ) , allowing golfers and clubmakers to fine-tune the flex for a stronger amateur-level player .

problems in hedging basket options can be of some significance when dealing with markets that exhibit a strong skew . many operators price basket options as if the underlying basket were a single commodity following its own stochastic process with its volatility derived from its own time series . this however conflicts with a fact that an average ( or any linear combination ) of assets with lognormal distribution does not follow lognormal distribution . this problem arises in swaps and eurodollar strips ( baskets of eurodollar options ) but in equities and fixed income it is mitigated by the fact that when correlation between assets is high , the sum would come closer to a lognormally distributed asset .

density functional theory ( dft ) methods are often considered to be " ab initio methods " for determining the molecular electronic structure , even though many of the most common functionals use parameters derived from empirical data , or from more complex calculations . in dft , the total energy is expressed in terms of the total one-electron density rather than the wave function . in this type of calculation , there is an approximate hamiltonian and an approximate expression for the total electron density . dft methods can be very accurate for little computational cost . some methods combine the density functional exchange functional with the hartree – fock exchange term and are termed hybrid functional methods .

using tandem ruckmen , often known as third man up , is a tactic often employed around the ground as a set play strategy . as only one ruckman from each side can be used at centre bounces , this tactic is restricted to boundary throw-ins and bounces . it involves a second tall or high jumping player from one of the sides contesting the ruck , typically when the taller ruckmen are wrestling at ground level or consistently ineffective in getting a clear tap away . the tactic has become especially popular during the 2015 season . it often results in a thump forward to keep the ball moving towards goal , as it is difficult for the often shorter player contesting the ruck to aim a tap . this is because they are not able to be assisted by lifting and can often be put off balance in the air when jumping over the top of ruckmen . additionally , by committing an extra player to the ruck contest , there is one less player from that team around the contest - though this can also have the effect of opening up space for more creative roving players . some key position players are designated secondary ruckmen for boundary throw-ins and will sometimes be used in tandem ruckwork .

from the high speed machine , the board transits to a precision placement machine . these pick-and-place machines often use high resolution verification cameras and fine adjustment systems via high precision linear encoders on each axis to place parts more accurately than the high-speed machines . furthermore , the precision placement machines are capable of handling larger or more irregularly shaped parts such as large package integrated circuits or packaged inductor coils and trimpots . unlike the rapid placers , precision placers generally do not use turret mounted nozzles and instead rely on a gantry-supported moving head . these precision placers rely upon placement heads with relatively few pickup nozzles . the head sometimes has a laser identifier that scans a reflective marker on the pc board to orient the head to the board . parts are picked up from tape feeders or trays , scanned by a camera ( on some machines ) , and then placed in the proper position on the board . some machines also center the parts on the head with two arms that close to center the part ; the head then rotates 90 degrees and the arms close again to center the part once more . the margin of error for some components is , in many cases , less than half a millimeter ( less than 0.02 inches ) . the process is a little slower than rapid placement , necessitating careful line balancing when setting up a job , lest the precision placement machine become a production bottleneck .

" who ? lopresti ? " mukada asks unconcerned . " no , satan " , kirk answers . he then asks mukada to perform an exorcism , but mukada refuses , saying that kirk is making a mockery of the priest 's religion . kirk begs one more time , telling mukada that " he " is coming . mukada , not buying into kirk 's " act " , tells him goodbye and that he will see him the day of kirk 's execution . as mukada walks away , kirk , in a demonic voice , says " mukada ! you can walk away , but i ' m not like the reverend cloutier . i won 't just disappear .

opposites : in myth opposites are often at work . apollo brings plague , but he also heals ; artemis hunts but also protects animals . hermes causes chaos by his trickery and also brings about refinement through his invention of the lyre . so is the same the case for herakles in euripides ' play of the same name . in it herakles realizes that he is not completely sure that he himself believes his father , zeus , is real . this doubt causes a lack of identity for him and may be a root cause of his angry and dangerous side . even though it is hera that sends madness to inflict herakles , it may also be that he is not emotionally sound or stable and this is what causes him to murder his wife and children . this dark and dangerous side of him contrasts with his positive and constructive side that makes the world better by ridding it of monsters . that he does such awful things and is still forgiven reflects a balance that is achieved between his opposing sides . heracles murders his family and he saves lives . the play in its dichotomous halves shows the inexorable reality of the existence of destructive and constructive forces in its principal hero , herakles .

the enzyme that precedes 6pgl in the pentose phosphate pathway , glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , exclusively forms the δ-isomer of 6-phosphogluconolactone . however , if accumulated , this compound can undergo intramolecular rearrangement to isomerize to the more stable γ-form , which is unable to be hydrolyzed by 6pgl and cannot continue to the non-oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway . by quickly hydrolyzing the δ-isomer of 6-phosphogluconolactone , 6pgl prevents its accumulation and subsequent formation of the γ-isomer , which would be wasteful of the glucose resources available to the cell . 6-phosphogluconolactone is also susceptible to attack from intracellular nucleophiles , evidenced by α-n-6-phosphogluconoylation of his-tagged proteins expressed in " e. coli " , and efficient hydrolysis of 6-phosphogluconolactone by 6pgl prevents lactone accumulation and consequent toxic reactions from occurring between the lactone intermediate and the cell .

in the next section , hume challenges " the doctrine of liberty " — the view that human beings are endowed with a distinctive kind of indeterministic free will — by setting out and debunking " the reasons for [ its ] prevalence " . first , since we confuse necessity with violent constraint , we end up confusing freedom from necessity ( the indeterministic " liberty of " indifference " " ) with freedom from violent constraint ( the compatibilist " liberty of " spontaneity " " ) . as a compatibilist , hume accepts the latter kind of free will , deeming it " that species of liberty , which it concerns us to preserve " and even " the most common sense of the word " ; but he rejects freedom from necessity as either " absurd " ( being nothing more than sheer " chance " ) or else " unintelligible " . second , we are deceived by a " false sensation of liberty " : when deliberating about our own actions , there is " a certain looseness " to the will , so that we can easily produce an " image or faint motion " for each alternative course of action . thus we end up convinced that we really could have acted differently , even though " a spectator can commonly infer our actions from our motives and character " . finally , we mistakenly think necessity poses a threat to moral responsibility , and is therefore " dangerous ... to religion and morality " . after noting that being " dangerous " is not the same as being " false " , hume recalls that his " necessity " is a very attenuated one : there is nothing dangerous or even controversial about saying that constant conjunction and causal inference apply to human action as well as physical objects . he then attempts to turn the tables on his opponents , arguing that necessity is in fact " essential " to moral responsibility : the rewards and punishments of human law would be pointless if human action were not regular and uniform , and divine punishment would be unjust if a person 's actions were a matter of sheer chance , lacking any causal connection to the person 's psychology , and revealing nothing about the person 's character . thus the threat to moral responsibility comes not from " necessity " , but from " indeterministic liberty " .
